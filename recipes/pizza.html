    <h2>An Easy, Quick, Homemade Pan Pizza</h2>
        <p>For this recipe, we will be making our own dough. No need for a stand mixer, all the kneading can be done by hand! Simply add the "dough" ingredients to a bowl, coat your hands in a bit of oil, and knead for 5-10 minutes until a smooth ball is formed. Then let rest for at least an hour, or up to 5 days in the fridge. After that, punch the ball down and spread the crust into a cast iron pan and let rest while we make our sauce</p>
        <p>For the sauce, mince the garlic cloves and cook in oil for 30 seconds (until fragrant) and then add the diced onion. Cook for 5 mins, and once softened, add the crushed tomatoes and stir. Once boiling, reduce heat to simmer and add the rest of the sauce ingredients. Let simmer for 5-10 minutes and then add salt to taste.</p>
        <p>Preheat your broiler to High. Back to the crust, put the cast iron pan on the stove, low heat, with the dough still in it. Let this cook until the bottom is crispy, and then remove from heat. Add the sauce (there will be plenty of leftover sauce), and any desired topping. Put the pizza in the broiling oven and cook for 5 mins or until cheese melts and crust is golden. Let cool for 5 mins and enjoy!</p>
